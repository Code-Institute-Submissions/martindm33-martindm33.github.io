## General info
This website was built as a submission for my first project in Code Institute's Full Stack Developer Diploma Course. It has been rebuilt twice as I have come to grips with the technologies involved and developed my own personal skills regarding planning and time management.

---

## Technologies
The site was built using [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) and components from [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/). It also makes use of [hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) by Ian Lunn. The colour palette was chosen using [Fabrizio Bianchi's](fabrizio.io) [Coolors](https://coolors.co).

## Aims

- Provide members with information about the upcoming movie

- Provide non-members with an understanding of the club and how it works

- Provide interested users with the steps to set up a similar cinema club for themselves

- Provide a history of previous showings which link to their respective [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) pages

## Audience

There are two expected audiences. Existing members of the cinema club and people interested in learning more about the club and how to run their own online movie night.

---

## Features

- large attention grabbing image ion the landing page, informing the user of the upciming film

## Design

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co) to select a 3 tone palette that felt visually striking but also clean.
