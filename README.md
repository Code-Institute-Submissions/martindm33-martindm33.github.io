## General info
This website was built as a submission for my first project in Code Institute's Full Stack Developer Diploma Course. It has been rebuilt twice as I have come to grips with the technologies involved and developed my own personal skills regarding planning and time management. In it's current state I consider it to be unfinished and incomplete.

---

## Technologies
The site was built using [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) and components from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). It also makes use of [hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) by Ian Lunn. The colour palette was chosen using [Fabrizio Bianchi's](fabrizio.io) [Coolors](https://coolors.co).

## Aims

- Provide members with information about the upcoming movie

- Provide interested users with the steps to set up a similar cinema club for themselves

- Provide a history of previous showings which link to their respective [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) pages

---

## Audience

There are two expected audiences. Existing members of the cinema club and people interested in learning more about the club and how to run their own online movie night.

---

## Features

- clear responsive navigation menu at the top of the page
- large attention grabbing image ion the landing page, informing the user of the upcoming film
- Instructions and links on how to set up your own cinema club

---

## Design

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co) to select a 3 tone palette that felt visually striking but also clean.

### Attribution

All film posters used on the reel page were obtained from Wikipedia.

The John Wick Action Figurine poster used on the main page can be found here: - [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ActionFigures/comments/d3hssl/recreated_the_john_wick_2_poster_hope_you_all/)

### Issues

I was unable to create a logo in that font that scaled properly with the page. I struggled greatly to make get breakpoints and other similar areas of web design to work in the way that I wanted.

I was unable to center the film reel cards, and also could not find a way to have all of them adapt responsively on the same line.

### Personal Note

I am unhappy with the finihsed product that I am submitting to you for this Milestone Assesment. While I feel I have learnt a lot, and come to understand how much I don't know yet, it is clear that I didn't have a well laid out plan and design for the site. I found myself struggling to move on from things I could not perfect, and rebuilding things over and over. THank you for taking the time to review and judge my project!
